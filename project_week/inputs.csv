Our agenda is to sell as many items of clothing as we possibly can, so that we can then donate the value collected to https://cleanclothes.org/donate . 
In order to achieve this goal, we need to make sure that the prices we set for the clothing is convenient for our buyers. Therefore, let us know the convenient prices for you by filling out a short survey (link mentioned below).
